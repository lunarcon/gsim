# gsim
<br>
simple (and fast!) orbital mechanics simulation using vectors <br>
just something fun i made for the weekend<br>
mutual gravitational attraction is simulated (increase zoom to see the earth-moon barycenter)<br>
i made the vectors 3 dimensional but didnt use the z compnoent so i put in a random small value<br>
